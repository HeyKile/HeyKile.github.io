Pick Perfect is a web app designed to help users identify if their plant is ripe enough to pick. After uploading an image of their plant, Google Gemini analyzes the image to decide of their crop is pick perfect.
To be blunt, this project is programmatically quite simple, but that was the point. Pick Perfect was our final project for a cloud computing class, which was  focused on utilizing GCP services and CI/CD workflows to achieve a product.
The UI was deployed using App Engine, as the simplicity of our app did not require anything more than an automatically scaling container with our frontend. The backend was deployed using Cloud Run to keep our API functionality entirely serverless. Deployment was entirely automated using GitHub Actions, utilizing service accounts to do all the hard work for us.
This project was actually quite fun to complete, as I had never deployed an app myself before. It was an eye-opening experience using GCP's services, and I now fully understand why start-ups and businesses use cloud services for all of their hosting. Walking away from this project, I feel much more familiar with using cloud services as well as setting up CI/CD pipelines.
