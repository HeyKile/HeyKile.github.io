Emberlite is an application designed to help mitigate healthcare worker burnout. Healthcare providers are asked to submit a short, non-intrusive survey every week outlining their current mental health status. Once filled out, the provider will be able to see their current mental health score, as well as their score over time. Most importantly, an administrator is able to view and manage the score of their entire team, intervening with anti-burnout measures when necessary. Burnout is an extremely prominent issue within healthcare, and taking steps to mitigate its effects will always be important.
This was created as a hackathon project for the Pitt Challenge 2023, which challenged students to solve healthcare-related problems. This project was a lot of firsts for me, as it was my first hackathon, first time using Python, and first time doing web development. Despites these hurdles and through a lot of determination, our team was not only able to complete the project, but we also won our track of "Burnout in Healthcare Workers." For my first hackathon, what more could I have asked for?
