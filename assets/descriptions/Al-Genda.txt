Al-Genda is an AI tool built to help Pitt students plan and design their class schedule. After entering their major, the number of semesters they have left, and the classes they've already taken, a list of questions is generated to gage the interests of the users to help them select classes. After answering the questions, the user is presented courses them might want to take. After selecting which courses they'd like too take, a schedule of those courses is planned out over their remaining semesters. The classes in these schedules are organized based on if prerequisites have been fulfilled, as well as the difficulty of the courses based on Rate My Professor reviews of said courses.
This project was my friends and I's submission for the Pitt Challenge 2024, the largest hackathon at Pitt. While we did not win any prizes, all of us were extremely proud of the work we were able to complete in a weekend. We were able to get a functioning application in just 24 hours, which is more that can be said for most creations. As well, we had the chance to work with a lot of external APIs, such as the Pitt API and the Rate My Professor API. Overall, this was a fun project where we got to show our skills as developers.
