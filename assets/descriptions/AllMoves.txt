This is a passion project of mine that I've wanted to build since I started programming 3 years ago. It combines my love of fitness with my passion for programming, making this one of the most rewarding projects I've worked on. This project was started as an in-class assignment for an interface design course, where I got to design, plan, and implement a beta-prototype with my friends Ruchi and Julianne. However, this project has become more than that for us, and we are looking to continue development of AllMoves into a complete package. In its current state, AllMoves is made of popsicle sticks, duct tape, and mocked data. While that was what was needed of us for class, we all want to use this app.
We are currently planning where to take AllMoves from here. After building our MVP, getting lots of feedback from test users and consultants, and become better at programming in Flutter, we have ideas on what we need to do next. We will be doing a lot of reimagining, redesigning, refactoring where we can, and building things entirely from scratch. For us, this app is not something we want to release ASAP to turn a profit, so we will instead be taking our time to build something we are truly proud of. AllMoves is going to be great, and I'm looking forward to tell you all about it. :)
