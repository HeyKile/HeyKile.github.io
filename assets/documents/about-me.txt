I love learning. Whether it's the latest technology, a new exercise in the gym, or a topic that's brand new to me, I want to know everything about it. This had lead me to discover some of my favorite hobbies, including programming! As someone who has always loved technology and creating, I find building software to be rewarding from conceptualization to completion. When I'm not coding, I'm either at the gym, playing a game, listening to a podcast, or diving down some niche wikipedia rabbit hole.
